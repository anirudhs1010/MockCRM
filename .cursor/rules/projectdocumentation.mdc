alwaysApply: true
Every time I receive new context about the project (such as new requirements, architectural decisions, API changes, or implementation details) that is not already present in Design.md, I will immediately add or update that information in the Design.md file. This ensures your design documentation always stays up to date with the latest project context.From now on, whenever I receive new project context that is not already in Design.md, I will automatically add or update it in that fileâ€”without asking for confirmation. This will keep your design documentation continuously up to date.
